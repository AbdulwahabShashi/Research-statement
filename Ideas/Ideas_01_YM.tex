\section{Problems in Yang-Mills theory}
\subsection{Running Coulomb gauge under Langevin dynamic}
Consider the Langevin dynamic of YM $A_t$. Then solve for $B_t$ by either setting up an elliptic equation or a parabolic equation for $B_t$. Most likely, this has to be done under small time parameter. Perhaps this will have something to do with ``Young boundary data", think of the recent works ``Stochastic evolution equations with rough boundary noise" by Neamtu-Seitz.
